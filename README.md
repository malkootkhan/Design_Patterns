## Implementation Aspects:  
### Product Interface (Product):  
Defines a common interface for all products with the productLookLike() method.   

### Concrete Products (Smartphone, Computer):  
Implement the Product interface and provide specific behavior for each product type.  

### Creator Class (Factory):  
Declares the factory method createProduct() that returns a Product object.  

### Concrete Creators (SmartphoneFactory, ComputerFactory):  
Implement the factory method to create and return instances of specific product types.  

### Main Function:  
Demonstrates the creation of different products using the factory method.  
Properly deletes the created objects to avoid memory leaks.  

### Advantages:  
*Encapsulation:* The main function does not need to know the details of how products are created. It simply uses the Factory interface.  
*Flexibility:* Adding new products only requires creating new Product and Factory subclasses without changing existing code.  
*Maintainability:* The code is modular and easy to extend with new product types.
